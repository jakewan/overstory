# Toolchain / CI Parity

Local development and CI must run the same tool versions and the same formatters. When they drift, a change passes locally and fails in CI (or the reverse), or CI silently tests a different Go than developers run. These three invariants are coupled across the files this rule conditions on — editing one file without its partner reintroduces the drift.

## golangci-lint version is one atomic value

The `golangci-lint` version is pinned in two places: `mise.toml` (the local binary) and the `golangci-lint-action` `version:` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (the CI binary). They must be identical. A config written for one minor can warn or error on another, so a mismatch means lint passes locally and fails in CI, or vice versa. When bumping, change both in the same commit.

## go.mod `go` directive tracks the mise Go pin

CI installs Go via `actions/setup-go` with `go-version-file: go.mod`, so the `go` directive in `go.mod` — not `mise.toml` — chooses the CI toolchain. Pin it to the same patch version as the `go` pin in `mise.toml`:

- A minor-only floor (`go 1.26`) lets CI float to the latest 1.26.x, drifting ahead of the pinned dev toolchain.
- A `.0` floor (`go 1.26.0`) pins CI to the oldest 1.26 patch, drifting behind it.
- The exact patch (`go 1.26.4`) makes CI install the same Go developers run. This is also what `go mod init`/`go mod tidy` write by default.

Bump `go.mod` and `mise.toml` together on a Go upgrade.

## pre-commit formats with CI's formatter set

CI's golangci-lint enforces the formatters configured in `.golangci.yml` (`gofmt` + `goimports`). The pre-commit hook in `lefthook.yml` runs `golangci-lint fmt`, which applies that same configured set and re-stages the result — so an import-ordering issue can't pass the commit hook only to fail the lint job later. A hook that runs only `gofmt` would leave that gap. If the formatters enabled in `.golangci.yml` change, the hook inherits them automatically; no second edit is needed.
