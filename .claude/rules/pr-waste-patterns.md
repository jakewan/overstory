# PR Waste Patterns

(extension point: `pr-waste-patterns`)

Waste in a PR diff in this project means artifacts that consume reviewer attention without creating value: scaffolding left over from development, debug instrumentation that didn't get removed, conflict resolution that didn't get cleaned up. The patterns below are the source of truth for what a PR health check should flag, regardless of which tool runs the scan — a reviewer doing it by hand reads this file directly; a tooling-assisted check consumes it via the `pr-waste-patterns` extension point.

A baseline scan need only catch conflict markers in added lines; everything else lives here so this Go project can express its language-specific waste set in one place.

## Patterns to Flag in Added Lines

- **Commented-out code blocks** — heuristic: 3+ consecutive commented lines in added code. Comments explaining intent are not waste; commented-out implementations are.
- **Debug instrumentation** — `fmt.Println`, `fmt.Printf` to stdout, `log.Println`/`log.Printf` left in non-error paths, `// DEBUG` comments. (Note: this MCP server speaks JSON-RPC over stdio — stray `fmt.Print*` to stdout can corrupt the protocol stream, so flag it with extra care.)
- **`TODO` / `FIXME` / `HACK` markers** — flag for visibility, not as blockers. This project treats `TODO` as a marker for future improvement, so a `TODO` in added code is normal — but the reviewer should see it called out and decide whether it needs a follow-up issue or is intentional in-flight scaffolding.

## Posture

A change without any pattern matches above is fine. The point of this list is to make the agent surface candidates the reviewer can reason about, not to gate merges.
